        <h1>Blockchain Mining & Staking System Architecture</h1>

        <h2>1. System Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Our blockchain mining and staking system is designed to enable users to earn cryptocurrency tokens through
          both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms without requiring initial financial investment.
          The system consists of several key components that work together to provide a secure, fair, and efficient
          platform for token generation and distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>2. System Architecture</h2>

        <h3>2.1 High-Level Architecture</h3>
        <p>The system is built on a three-tier architecture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Client Layer:</strong> User-facing applications (desktop, web, mobile)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Layer:</strong> API services, node selection, reward calculation, security services
          </li>

        <h3>4.1 Mining Process</h3>
        <pre className="bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto">
          {`
1. User installs and configures mining software
2. Mining software connects to Node Manager to get assigned to optimal node
3. Mining software contributes computational resources to solve PoW puzzles
4. Successful solutions are submitted to the network for verification
5. Verified contributions are recorded on the blockchain
6. Reward Calculator determines token allocation based on contribution
7. Tokens are distributed to user's wallet
8. User can view earnings in real-time through the client interface
          `}
        </pre>

        <h3>4.2 Staking Process</h3>
        <pre className="bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto">
          {`
1. User accumulates tokens through mining
2. User selects amount and duration for staking through wallet interface
3. Staking request is processed by the staking smart contract
4. Tokens are locked for the specified duration
5. User's stake contributes to block validation in the PoS consensus
